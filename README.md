# Overview
The game "Hover Hero", created for the "Active Sports Games" and "Advanced Shading Techniques" lectures.

This is a "Temple Run" inspired Kinect game, featuring pop culture items & references.

To build the game, a paid unity plugin from the [asset store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/kinect-v2-examples-with-ms-sdk-and-nuitrack-sdk-18708) is required. Because neither the package nor its content is not uploaded, some modification is needed in order for the game to run:
- The packaged KinectScripts folder content needs to be copied into the ThirdParty/Kinect_Plugin folder 
- The packaged StandartAssets folder content needs to be added to the ThirdParty/StandardAssets folder.
